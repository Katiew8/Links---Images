      <h2 class="space world" id="china">China</h2>
      <p>In China, only about one percent of people are Christians, so most people only know a few things about
        Christmas.
        Because of this, Christmas is only often celebrated in major cities.
        In these big cities there are Christmas Trees, lights and other decorations on the streets and in department
        stores.
        Santa Claus is called 'Shen Dan Lao Ren' and has grottos in shops like in Europe and America.
        The post men might dress up as Santa when delivering letters before Christmas!
        More young people are celebrating Christmas in cities where Christmas parties are becoming popular and it's also
        a
        time where young couples will be gifts for each other, a bit like Valentine's day.
        In Chinese Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Sheng Dan Kuai Le or 圣诞快乐' in Mandarin and 'Seng Dan Fai Lok or 聖誕快樂' in
        Cantonese.
        Happy/Merry Christmas in lots more languages.
        In China, Santa is known as 'Sheng dan lao ren' (Traditional: 聖誕老人, Simplified: 圣诞老人; means Old Christmas Man).
        Only a few people have a Christmas Tree.
        If people do have a tree it is normally a plastic one and might be decorated with paper chains, paper flowers,
        and
        paper lanterns (they might also call it a tree of light).
        The Christmas Trees that most people would see would be in shopping malls.
        The strange thing is that most of the world's plastic Christmas Trees and Christmas decorations are made in
        China,
        but the people making them might not have decorations like them in their own homes at Christmas!
        A tradition that's becoming popular, on Christmas Eve, is giving apples.
        Many stores have apples wrapped up in colored paper for sale.
        People give apples on Christmas Eve because in Chinese Christmas Eve is called "Ping'an Ye" (平安夜), meaning
        peaceful or quiet evening, which has been translated from the carol 'Silent Night'.
        The word for apple in Mandarin is "píngguǒ" (苹果) which sounds like the word for peace.
        Some people go Carol singing, although not many people understand them or know about the Christmas Story.
        Jingle Bells is a popular Christmas song in China!
        People who are Christians in China go to special services. Going to Midnight Mass services has become very
        popular.

      <h2 class="space world" id="egypt">Egypt</h2>
      <p>In Egypt about 15% of people are Christians. They are the only part of the population who really celebrate
        Christmas as a religious festival. Most Egyptian Christians belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church and they have
        some very unique traditions for Christmas.
        Christmas Day isn't celebrated on the 25th December but on 7th January (like in Ethiopia and by some Orthodox
        Christians in Russia and Serbia).
        The Coptic month leading to Christmas is called Kiahk. People sing special praise songs on Saturday nights
        before the Sunday Service.</p>
      <p>For the 43 days before Christmas (Advent), from 25th November to 6th January, Coptic Orthodox Christians have a
        special fast where they basically eat a vegan diet.
        They don't eat anything containing products that come from animals (including chicken, beef, milk and eggs).
        This is called 'The Holy Nativity Fast'.
        But if people are too weak or ill to fast properly they can be excused.</p>
      <p>On Coptic Christmas Eve (6th January), Coptic Christians go to church for a special liturgy or Service.
        The services normally start about 10.30pm but some chapels will be open for people to pray from 10.00pm. Many
        people meet up with their friends and families in the churches from 9.00pm onwards.
        The services are normally finished shortly after midnight, but some go onto 4.00am!
        When the Christmas service ends people go home to eat the big Christmas meal. All the foods contain meat, eggs
        and butter - all the yummy things they didn't during the Advent fast!
        One popular course is 'Fata'(1) .</p>
      <p>On the Orthodox Christmas Day (7th) people come together in homes for parties and festivities. People often
        take
        'kahk' (2) with them to give as gifts.
        Even though not many in Egypt are Christians, a lot of people in the country like to celebrate Christmas as a
        secular holiday. Christmas is becoming very commercial and most major supermarkets sell Christmas trees,
        Christmas food and decorations. Hotels, parks and streets are decorated for Christmas.
        In Egypt, Santa is called Baba Noël (3). Children hope that he will climb through a window and will leave some
        presents! They might leave some kahk out for Baba Noël.
        Most Egyptians speak Egyptian Arabic. In Arabic Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Eid Milad Majid' (عيد ميلاد مجيد)
        which means 'Glorious Birth Feast'. Happy/Merry Christmas in lots more languages. 'Christmas' in Arabic is 'eid
        almilad' (عيد الميلاد).

      <h2 class="space world" id="italy"> Italy</h2>
      <p>One of the most important ways of celebrating Christmas in Italy is the Nativity crib scene. Using a Nativity
        scene to help tell the Christmas story was made very popular by St. Francis of Assisi in 1223 (Assisi is in
        mid-Italy). The previous year he had visited Bethlehem and saw where it was thought that Jesus was born. A lot
        of
        Italian families have a Nativity scene in their homes.
        The city of Naples in Italy is world famous for its Nativity scenes. These are known as 'Presepe Napoletano'
        (1). The first Nativity scene in Naples is thought to go back to 1025 and
        was in the Church of S. Maria del presepe (2), this was even before St. Francis of Assisi
        had made Nativity scenes very popular!
        Having Nativity scenes in your own home became popular in the 16th century and it's still popular today (before
        that only churches and monasteries had scenes). Nativity scenes are traditionally put out on the 8th December.
        But
        the figure of the baby Jesus isn't put into the crib/manger until the evening/night of December 24th!
        Sometimes the Nativity scene is displayed in the shape of pyramid which can be meters tall! It's made of several
        tiers of shelves and is decorated with colored paper, gold covered pinecones and small candles. A small star is
        often hung inside the top of the pyramid/triangle. The shelves above the manger scene might also contain fruit,
        candy and presents.
        One special thing about Neapolitan Nativity scenes, is that they always have extra 'every day' people and
        objects
        (such as houses, waterfalls, food, animals and even figures of famous people and politicians!). Naples is also
        the
        home to the largest Nativity scene in the world, which has over 600 objects on it!
        In Naples there is a still a street of nativity scene makers called the 'Via San Gregorio Armeno'. In the street
        you can buy wonderful hand made Nativity scene decorations and figures - and of course whole scenes!
        One old Italian custom is that children go out Carol singing and playing songs on shepherds pipes, wearing
        shepherds sandals and hats.
        On Christmas Eve, it's common that no meat (and also sometimes no dairy) is eaten. Often a light seafood meal is
        eaten and then people go to the Midnight Mass service. The types of fish and how they are served vary between
        different regions in Italy.
        When people return from Mass, if it's cold, you might have a slice of Italian Christmas Cake called 'Panettone'
        (3)! </p>
      <p>For many Italian-American families a big Christmas Eve meal of different fish dishes is now a very popular
        tradition! It's known as The Feast of the Seven Fishes ('Festa dei sette pesci' in Italian). The feast seems to
        have its root in southern Italy and was bought over to the USA by Italian immigrants in the 1800s. It now seems
        more popular in American than it is in Italy!
        Common types of fish eaten in the feast include Baccala (4), Clams, Calamari, Sardines and Eel.
        There are different theories as to why there are seven fish dishes eaten. Some think that seven represents the
        seven days of creation in the Bible, other say it represents the seven holy sacraments of the Catholic Church.
        But
        some families have more than seven dishes! You might have nine (to represent the Christian trinity times three),
        13 (to represent Jesus and his 12 disciples) or 11 (for the 11 disciples without Jesus or Judas!)!
        The Christmas celebrations start eight days before Christmas with special 'Novenas' or a series of prayers and
        church services.
        Some families have a 'Ceppo' or Yule Log which is burnt through the Christmas season.
        In Italian Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Buon Natale', in Sicilian it's 'Bon Natali' and in Ladin (spoken in some
        parts of the northern Italian region of South Tyrol) it's 'Bon/Bun Nadèl'. Happy/Merry Christmas in lots more
        languages.</p>
      <p>Epiphany is also important in Italy. On Epiphany night, children believe that an old lady called 'Befana'
        brings
        presents for them. The story about Befana bringing presents is very similar to the story of Babushka. Children
        put
        stockings up by the fireplace for Befana to fill. In parts of northern Italy, the Three Kings might bring you
        present rather than Befana. On Christmas day 'Babbo Natale' (5) might bring them some small gifts, but
        the main day for present giving is on Epiphany.</p>

      <h2 class="space world" id="africa"> South Africa</h2>
      <p>Because South Africa is in the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas comes in the summer. So there's lots of sun and
        beautiful flowers in full bloom.
        The schools are closed for the Christmas holidays and some people like to go camping. Going carol singing, on
        Christmas Eve, is very popular in towns and cities. Carols by Candlelight services are also popular on Christmas
        Eve. And many people go to a Christmas morning Church Service.
        Traditional 'fir' Christmas Trees are popular and children leave a stocking out for Santa Claus on Christmas
        Eve.
        The Christmas meal is either turkey, duck, roast beef or suckling pig with yellow rice & raisins and vegetables,
        followed by Christmas Pudding or a traditional South African dessert called Malva Pudding (sometimes also called
        Lekker Pudding) - get the recipe. People also like to pull Christmas Crackers! The meal is often eaten outside
        in the summer sun! If it's really hot they might even have a barbecue or 'braai'. Mince pies are also popular.
        South Africa also has several other UK Christmas traditions, because of its history with the UK.
        On Christmas day afternoon, people visit family and friends or might go for a trip into the country side to play
        games or have a swim.
        Boxing Day is also a public holiday in South Africa and again people like to be 'out and about' having a good
        time!
        In Afrikaans (one the languages spoken in South Africa) Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Geseënde Kersfees'; in Zulu
        it's 'UKhisimusi omuhle', in Sesotho it's 'Le be le keresemese e monate' and in Xhosa it's 'Krismesi emnandi'.
        Happy/Merry Christmas in lots more languages.
        Santa Claus is also known as Sinterklaas (St Nicholas) & Kersvader (Father Christmas) for people who speak
        Afrikaans (which has a base in Dutch).</p>

      <h2 class="space world" id="us">United States</h2>
      <p>The United States of America has many different traditions and ways that people celebrate Christmas, because
        ofits multi-cultural nature.
        Many customs are similar to ones in the UK, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland and Mexico.
        The traditional meal for Western European families is turkey or ham with cranberry sauce.
        Families from Eastern European origins favour turkey with trimmings, keilbasi (1), cabbage dishes, and soups;
        and
        some Italian families prefer lasagne!
        Some Americans use pop-corn threaded on string to help decorate their Christmas Tree.
        Making gingerbread houses is also popular to make and eat at Christmas!
        Eggnog (2) is a 'traditional' Christmas drink in the USA.
        Many Americans, especially Christians will go to Church to celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas.
        Many churches have special Christmas Carol services and events where the story of Christmas is told.
        Americans also send out Christmas Cards, like Carol singing and there's the unusual custom of the Christmas
        Pickle
        (3)!
        People in America like to decorate the outsides of their houses with lights and sometimes even statues of Santa
        Claus, Snowmen and Reindeer.
        Some cookies and glass of milk are often left out as a snack for Santa on Christmas Eve!</p>
      <p>Towns and cities often decorate the streets with lights and Christmas trees to celebrate Christmas.
        Christmas Trees were first put up in the USA by German immigrants in Pennsylvania.
        There were some community trees as early as the 1750s.
        But outside of these communities, trees would have been thought of as very odd!
        The Puritans, who founded much of New England the eastern USA only thought of Christmas as a religious festival.
        In 1659 a court in Massachusetts made a law that to do anything to mark December 25th, apart from going to
        Church,
        illegal!
        The first recorded tree in a home in the USA was set-up in 1832 by Charles Follen of Boston - who was a German
        political refugee.
        We know about it because of his wife's memoirs written 10 years later.
        There are more records of early American trees in diaries and letters from 1842 in Virginia, 1847 in Ohio and
        1851
        in South Carolina and Mississippi.
        A drawing of Queen Victoria and her family around the tree in Windsor Castle from 1848 was republished in
        Godey's
        Lady's Book, Philadelphia in December 1850 (but they removed the Queen's crown and Prince Albert's moustache to
        make it look 'American'!).
        The first recorded Christmas Tree lot selling trees in the USA was in New York in 1851 when a Mark Carr loaded
        two
        sleds with trees from the Catskill Mountains and sold them in the city.
        By the 1890s the Catskills were providing over 200,000 trees a year to the New York area!
        The first US president recorded with a tree at Christmas is Andrew Jackson in 1835.
        However, this tree was a small sugar frosted pine tree.
        The first Christmas Tree in the White House was set-up in 1856 when Franklin Pierce was president.
        The first electric lights on a tree at the White House was in 1895 when Grover Cleveland used them. \
        The tradition of having a tree on the lawn of the White House was started in 1923 by Calvin Coolidge.
        Trees became more popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s when more people had them in their houses and cities
        started having communal lighted trees.
        There was a tree in San Diego in 1904, in Pasadena in 1909, in New York, Boston and Cleveland in 1912 and in
        Philadelphia in 1914.
        Frank Woolworth started selling glass ornaments in his stores in 1880.
        In 1910 the Sears catalogue started selling ornaments by mail order.
        According to The Guinness World Records, the tallest cut Christmas tree was a 67.36m (221 ft) Douglas fir setup
        at
        the Northgate Shopping Center in Seattle, Washington, USA, in December 1950.
